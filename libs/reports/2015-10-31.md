# Subteam report: libs 2015-10-31

## Highlights

From last week, we had two RFCs in FCP:

- [FCP PR #1291](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1291)
  RFC: Promote the `libc` crate from the nursery -- merged, now available in the
  [main repository][libc], and a version bump will be coming soon!
- [FCP PR #1307](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1307)
  Add some additional utility methods to OsString and OsStr - merged, and
  [tracking issue][osstring]

Two new RFCs were moved into FCP this week as well:

- [FCP PR #1270](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1270)
  RFC: #[deprecated] for Everyone
- [FCP PR #1288](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1288)
  Improvements to the Time APIs

As a reminder, this coming week is where we'll decide on the set of FCP issues
for APIs in the standard library to stabilize during the 1.6 cycle. If you've
got an API you'd like to see stable, please feel free to comment on the [list of
issues][issue-unstable].

[libc]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/libc
[osstring]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29453
[issue-unstable]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AB-unstable+label%3AT-libs
