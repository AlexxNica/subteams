# Subteam report: libs 2016-05-23

This week we decided on API stabilizations for the 1.10 release:

- static sync primitives - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27717
    - deprecate
    - recommend lazy static, which is destined for `std` eventually
- OpenOptionsExt on windows - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27720
    - stabilize -- alex will verify
- char encoding - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27784
    - stablize write_utf8
    - don't stabilize others
- OpenOptions expansion - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30014
    - stabilize after verification
- Weak::new - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30425
    - stabilize + add default
- panic hooks - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30449
    - stabilize
- CStr::from_bytes_with_nul - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31190
    - stabilize
- SystemTime + fs::Metadata - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31399
    - stabilize
- compare_exchange - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31767
    - stabilize
- is_empty - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32111
    - deprecate
- exposing keys from Entry - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32281
    - stabilize
- unix sockets - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32312
    - stabilize
- Map values_mut - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32551
    - stabilize
- binary_search_by_key - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33018
    - stabilize

We also discussed the policy around Rust compiler version support and
`rust-lang` crates, which resulted in a new
[policy RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1619).

Finally, this week saw a
[major RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1620) covering the regex
crate, which will ultimately transition it to 1.0 and full `rust-lang` status.
