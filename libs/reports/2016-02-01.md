# Subteam report: libs 2016-02-01

## Highlights

This week we moved several RFCs into **final comment period** (FCP):

- [FCP PR #1299](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1299):
  std::sync::mpsc::SharedSender
- [FCP PR #1353](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1353):
  Add retain_mut to Vec and VecDeque
- [FCP PR #1359](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1359):
  RFC: Add CommandExt::{exec, before_exec}
- [FCP PR #1415](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1415):
  RFC: Deprecate type aliases in std::os::*::raw
- [FCP PR #1423](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1423):
  Amend RFC 1270 to describe actual implementation

We also selected unstable APIs to consider for stabilization or deprecation in Rust 1.8:

- [`str::encode_utf16`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27714)
  - Recommendation: stabilize (renamed from `utf16_units`)
- [scoped tls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27715)
  - Recommendation: deprecate (move to crates.io probably)
- [cell extras](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27746)
  - Recommendation: stabilize `map`, deprecate `filter_map`, also handle other guard types
- [`Condvar::wait_timeout_with`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27748)
  - Recommendation: deprecate
- [raw ptr `as_ref`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27780)
  - On the fence, comments welcome!
- [`make_ascii_uppercase`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27809)
  - Recommendation: deprecate
- [`drop_in_place`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27908)
  - Recommendation: stabilize, but would like comments on `*mut T` vs `&mut T`
- [overloaded += operators](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28235)
  - Recommendation: stabilize
- [`std::time`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29866)
  - Recommendation: stabilize, but rename `duration_from_earlier`
- [`panic::recover`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27719)
  - Recommendation: neither stabilize nor deprecate, but we would like
    to make a decision for the 1.9 release, so we're trying to
    instigate early discussion about this controversial API.
