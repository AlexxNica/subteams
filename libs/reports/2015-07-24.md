# Subteam report: libs 2015-07-24

## Highlights

A little belated this week and we slipped last week, so there's definitely a few
things to catch up on! The libs team didn't hold a triage meeting this week due
to many attendees having conflicts at the normal time, but we should make
progress on the FCP RFCs and new PRs next week.

First up this week, @Gankro would like to call out @tshepang as Friend of the
Tree!

> Over the last year Tshepang has landed over 100 improvements to our
> documentation. Tshepang saw where documentation was not, and said "No. This
> will not do."
>
> We should all endeavor to care about docs as much as Tshepang.

As a summary of last week's actions:

RFCs going into their **final comment period**:

- [FCP PR #1184](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1184):
  RFC: Stabilize the #![no_std] attribute
- [FCP PR #1183](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1183):
  RFC: Allow changing the default allocator
- [FCP PR #770](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/770):
  io error handling design

Decisions from last week:

- [FCP PR #1174](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1174):
  RFC for creation of `IntoRaw{Fd, Socket, Handle}` trait to complement `AsRaw*`
  - [Merged](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1174#issuecomment-121826735)
- [PR #26743](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26743):
  Add a method `lines_any` to `BufRead`
  - [Closed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26743#issuecomment-121827213).
    The [associated RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1212) will be
    considered instead.
- [FCP PR #1158](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1158):
  RFC: Expand the std::net module
  - Postponed, pending some policy decisions about how to handle major new API
    additions in std. We should have more details on this next week.

In the triage meeting last week we also discussed the story for adding new large
portions of functionality to the standard library (e.g. the `std::net` RFC), and
we will be posting our conclusions soon about this topic.
