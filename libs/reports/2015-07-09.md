# Subteam report: libs 2015-07-09

## Highlights

We've begun weekly video meetings with the entire subteam, which should increase
our bandwidth and enable more progress on new library initiatives. Over the next
week, we plan to discuss the pipeline for crates eventually heading into std,
and (relatedly) the fate of `rust-lang` crates. This week, though, we focused
mainly on existing business.

RFCs going into their **final comment period**:

- [FCP PR #1158](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1158):
  RFC: Expand the std::net module
- [FCP PR #1174](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1174):
  RFC for creation of `IntoRaw{Fd, Socket, Handle}` trait to complement `AsRaw*`

PRs in **final comment period**:

- [FCP PR  #26743](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26743):
  Add a method `lines_any` to `BufRead`
