# Subteam report: libs 2016-04-16

## Highlights

This week during triage the libs team discussed [RFC 1505] and [RFC 1543]. We
decided that the time wasn't quite ripe for `Atomic<T>` in the standard library
([RFC 1505]), but [RFC 1543][] [was merged].

[RFC 1505]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1505
[RFC 1543]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1543
[was merged]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1543#issuecomment-210207931

We also discussed a few PRs, some notable ones being:

* [PR 32693] - Adding `binary_search_by_key` to slices
* [PR 32785] - Adding `Default` to a few `sync` primitives and other types
* [PR 32866] - Adding `From<Vec<T>> for VecDeque<T>` and vice versa

[PR 32693]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32693
[PR 32785]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32785
[PR 32866]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32866

Finally, the following RFCs have moved into their week-long **final comment
period**. Please feel free to add your final thoughts!

- [FCP PR #1480](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1480):
  RFC proposal for thread affinity
- [FCP PR #1521](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1521):
