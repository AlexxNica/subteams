# Subteam report: libs 2016-03-04

## Highlights

This week we reached decisions on a number of PRs affecting `std` APIs.

In addition, we are moving several RFCs into **final comment period**:

- [FCP PR #1432](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1432):
  String/Vec::splice(RangeArgument, IntoIterator)
- [FCP PR #1434](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1434):
  'Contains' method for ranges
- [FCP PR #1479](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1479):
  Unix socket support in the standard library
- [FCP PR #1498](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1498):
  Add octet-oriented interface to std::net::Ipv6Addr

Next week we will be choosing APIs to consider for stabilization/deprecation in
1.9. Please take a look at
[the list](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AT-libs+label%3AB-unstable)
and leave comments on any APIs you think should be considered!
