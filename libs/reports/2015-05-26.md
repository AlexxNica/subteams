# Subteam report: libs 2015-05-26

Welcome to the first library subteam status report!

These reports will call out some of the important team activity each
week, including announcements that an RFC or implementation has
entered the "final comment period" (FCP). The FCP lasts for one week,
and is an opportunity to get a last round of feedback, and final
opinions from subteam members, before an RFC is merged or feature is
stabilized.

We've been bogged down for the past few weeks with, you know, the 1.0
release as well as getting the subteams up and running. As such, we
have something of a backlog of RFCs. If you have been waiting for
feedback on your RFC -- sorry! -- the subteam will get to it soon.

I'll be working this week with subteam members to close out some of
the RFC that no longer make sense (given that 1.0 has been shipped),
and to re-assign shepherds to get the ball rolling again.

RFC shepherds or authors, if you want to move a library RFC to the FCP
next week, please let me know. --aturon

## Highlights

The following RFCs are entering their final comment period (FCP),
ending on June 2:

- [PR #583](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/583):
  Add fmt size_hints
- [PR #590](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/590):
  Early trait bounds on generic types
- [PR #839](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/839):
  Have collections impl Extend<&T> where T: Clone
- [PR #1014](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1014):
  Don't panic when stdout doesn't exist
- [PR #1034](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1034):
  RFC: Deprecate `Iterator::size_hint` and `ExactSizeIterator` for better named alternatives.

In addition, I'd like to call attention to the following RFCs that are
approaching FCP, but could use more discussion:

- [PR #1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1105):
  RFC: Policy on semver and API evolution
- [PR #1055](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1055):
  RFC for redirecting stdio of child processes to open file handles
