# Subteam report: libs 2015-10-09

## Highlights

There were no FCPs last week, but we're introducing several this week:

- [FCP PR #1254](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1254):
  ordered ranges 2.0
- [FCP PR #1255](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1255):
  RFC: Stabilize OS string to bytes conversions
- [FCP PR #1257](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1257):
  RFC: `.drain(range)` and `.drain()`

We also closed the following pre-1.0 RFC:

- [PR #1036](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1036):
  Add Builder guidelines

We would like to get some attention on the following RFC:

- [PR #1252](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1252):
  Document and expand the open options

Otherwise, we talked about gaps in the ecosystem and crates.io
infrastructure that we might work on in the coming months.
