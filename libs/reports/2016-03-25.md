# Subteam report: libs 2016-03-25

## Highlights

Several RFCs enter their **final comment period** this week:

- [FCP PR #1398](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1398):
  Allocators, take III
  - Proposes a comprehensive API for describing and using allocators, with the
    intent that types like `Vec` and `HashMap` can ultimately support custom
    allocators.
- [FCP PR #1529](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1529):
  rfc 1291: Add libutil to scope of libc crate on Linux
- [FCP PR #1552](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1552):
  Add a contains method to VecDeque and LinkedList

As usual, we covered several PRs that needed team decisions:

- [Decreasing code bloat when deriving Clone for Copy data](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31414)
  - We want to do this, but had some reservations about the initially-proposed approach.
- [Changing AtomicBool size to 1 byte](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32365)
  - We want to reach a decision here while resolving open RFCs on the topic.
- [Placement for Vec](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32366)
  - We want to add these APIs, but are wary of doing so in an ad hoc way without
    any conventions (and thereby de facto stabilizing poor conventions); blocked
    on a quick conventions RFC.
- [Heap allocation guarantee](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32383)
  - We are fine with making this promise, but would like to avoid a lot of ad
    hoc promise-making along these lines, in favor of a more comprehensive look
    at representation promises.
- [Add augmented assignment to time times](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32448)
  - Merged

We did some maintenance on the nursery:

- [Making progress on rustc-serialize without breakage](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-serialize/issues/115)
- We need to consolidate the time libraries in the ecosystem, and in particular
  make the external time libraries compatible with the new `std::time`
  types. Ideally, this would happen by deprecating the
  [`time` crate](https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated/time/) in favor of
  [`chrono`](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-chrono), and making `chrono`
  more `std`-compatible. The libs team is working with the relevant authors to
  make progress here.
- Dealing with `libc`/`std::os::raw` types and their interaction.
  - Not fully resolved -- ongoing discussion is
    [here](http://internals.rust-lang.org/t/solve-std-os-raw-c-void/3268).
