## Highlights

First off, we had a great RustCamp last weekend! As many of us were
involved with the event, it was a bit of a slow week.

Decisions from last week:

  RFC: Stabilize the #![no_std] attribute
  - Merged
- [RFC PR #1183](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1183):
  RFC: Allow changing the default allocator
  - Merged
- [RFC PR #770](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/770):
  io error handling design
  - Closed
- [RFC PR #980](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/980):
  read_exact
  - Merged
- [RFC PR #1194](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1194):
  RFC: Add item recovery collection APIs
  - To be merged, pending last bits of bikeshedding
- [PR #26818](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26818):
  Stabilize duration (with renamings)
  - Merge, need to decide about 1.3 backport

We'd like to call attention to the following two policy RFCs:

- [PR #1242](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1242):
  RFC: policy for rust-lang crates
- [PR #1224](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1224):
  Update the RFC process with sub-teams, amongst other things.

as well as an RFC relating to `catch_panic` and exception safety in Rust:

- [PR #1236](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1236):
  RFC: Stabilize catch_panic

This week's RFCs going into (or staying in) **final comment period**:

- [FCP PR #1195](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1195):
  ordered query API
- [FCP PR #1192](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1192):
  RFC for inclusive ranges with ...
