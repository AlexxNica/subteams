# Subteam report: compiler 2015-09-04

## Highlights

Some exciting PRs landing this week. First, nrc's first [HIR PR][1],
which itself doesn't do much, but hopefully is a modest starting point
for a stable AST API and so forth. Second, the [MIR PR][2] by yours
truly looks likely to land, if I can find the time to fix a lingering
issues on Windows. Third, a
[small tweak to the trait matching code][3] by arielb1 that yields a
nice little performance improvement.
