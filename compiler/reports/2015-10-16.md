# Subteam report: compiler 2015-10-16

## Highlights

We decided to place one RFC into FCP:

- [RFC 1298](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1298): Incremental
  compilation
  
I would also like to declare [Ryan Prichard][] a **Friend of the
Tree**. Over the last few months, Ryan has been comparing the Rust
compiler's parsing behavior with that of the
[rust-grammar project][rust-grammar], which aims to create a LALR(1)
grammar for parsing Rust. Ryan has found a number of inconsistencies
and bugs between the two. This kind of work is useful for two reasons:
it finds bugs, obviously, which are often hard to uncover any other
way. Second, it helps pave the way for a true Rust reference grammar
outside of the compiler source itself. So Ryan Prichard, thanks!

[issues]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/created_by/rprichard
[rust-grammar]: https://github.com/bleibig/rust-grammar

Finally, and on a more grave note, let me add that there have been a
number of regressions popping up on nightly builds this week, so we
are aiming to have those squashed down soon.

Thanks!
