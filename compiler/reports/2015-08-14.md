# Subteam report: compiler 2015-08-14

## Highlights

Perhaps the most exciting thing going on right now is @huonw's PR

to merge the [MIR RFC][2].

[1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27169
[2]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1211

  Very confusing error on attempt to pass `path::Path` by value
- [Issue #26251](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26251):
  match expression falling through?
- [Issue #26656](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26656):
  dropck can be bypassed via a trait object method
