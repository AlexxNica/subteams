# Subteam report: compiler 2016-05-07

## Highlights

Much of the meeting this week was devoted to discussing and planning
for next week's development sprint -- the compiler team and active
rustc contributors will be gathering in mountain view for a focused
week of hacking and planning. We are aiming to push the ball forward
on both MIR adoption and incremental compilation, as well as plotting
out how to revamp the compiler to be more performant and flexible.
