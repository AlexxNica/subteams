# Subteam report: compiler 2015-12-04

## Highlights

This week there was a fair amount of triage and discussion of the high
priority bugs below.

One issue that was raised, but not firmly settled, was what the policy
ought to be towards breaking changes in libsyntax. Clearly there are a
number of people "in the wild" who rely on libsyntax, and so some
amount of consideration is warranted, and yet just as clearly we need
to continue to evolve that crate -- and in some cases dramatically --
as the compiler evolves. It's not clear yet if there is a satisfactory
middle-ground.
