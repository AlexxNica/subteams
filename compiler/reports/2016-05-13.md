# Subteam report: compiler 2016-05-13

## Highlights

The compiler team has all gathered together at Mozilla's offices in
Mountain View in the first ever "rustc development sprint". We've been
hacking away on MIR support as well as incremental compilation, and
progress has been quite rapid. As of this writing, the hardest part of
the backend work on incremental compilation appears to be nearing
completion -- restructuring the backend to create the reusable codegen
units. In MIR land, a number of optimization improvements have landed,
and there is even preliminary work on implementing
[non-zeroing drop](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33622).
Finally, we've had a number of good architectural discussions.
