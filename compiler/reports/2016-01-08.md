# Subteam report: compiler 2016-01-08

## Highlights

This week has seen a number of MIR PRs land, including a
[large overhaul of how calls and panics are handled][30481] by Simonas
Kazlauskas and a [new and improved graphviz format][30602] by Scott
Olson. Nice work!

These is continued progress towards incremental compilation.  In
particular, [PR #30532](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30532)
(by yours truly) lays out the infrastructure for tracking dependencies
within the compiler.
