# Subteam report: compiler 2016-05-20

## Highlights

I mentioned that last week we had our first ever "compiler team
development sprint".  I wanted to give a few more details on what we
did during the week.

First off, we had a number of design discussions,
covering such topics as incremental compilation, the shortest path to
IDE integration, and how to restructure the compiler to move lifetime
checking so that it operates on the MIR (which is required for
[non-lexical lifetimes][nll]).

Secondly, we did a lot of hacking! Some of the notable highlights were:

- arielb1 implemented a
  [more-or-less working version of non-zeroing drop](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33622)!
- pnkfelix implemented a [number of fixes and a unit-testing framework](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33667)
  for the dataflow framework that underlies the non-zeroing drop work.
- nagisa implemented a
  [lattice-based dataflow framework](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33628)
  for constant propagation and other optimizations on MIR.
- eddyb hacked up the compiler to
  [save metadata even when not generating code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33602),
  which could serve as the basis for a cross-crate version of
  [cargo check][] (think: very fast type-checking while you are
  working). He also worked on some refactorings in support of incremental
  compilation.
- nrc made a number of improvements to [rustw][], interfacing it to
  the compiler's metadata so it can support things like "go to
  definition" etc. This will hopefully evolve into something that
  other IDEs can tap into as well.
- mw and aatch made great progress on refactoring the back-end of the
  compiler to be more suitable for incremental compilation; we're
  getting close to a working prototype!
- doener made a number of small improvements to MIR that collectively
  had a huge impact on the time it takes to translate various crates
  using MIR.
- nmatsakis (that's me!) fixed a
  [horrible bug in the lifetime errors](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33539)
  that was often causing them to give terrible suggestions, and made some
  improvements to track incremental changes across crates.
- Alon Zakai and Brian Anderson did some preliminary hacking that
  allowed us to translate Rust MIR into
  [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly),
  successfully converting a simple "hello, world" style example.
