# Subteam report: compiler 2015-07-24

## Dashboard

We decided to accept [RFC #1191], on adding a HIR to the compiler.

In addition, [RFC #1211] has entered into final comment period.  This
RFC describes a mid-level, simplified IR that will be constructed
after type-checking but be used to drive advanced analysis and code
generation.

### Implementation phase


### High priority issues

- [Issue #23286](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23286):
  Very confusing error on attempt to pass `path::Path` by value
- [Issue #26251](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26251):
  match expression falling through?
- [Issue #26656](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26656):
  dropck can be bypassed via a trait object method
- [Issue #27060](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060):
  repr(packed) allows invalid unaligned loads
