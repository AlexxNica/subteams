We decided to close RFC 1457, due to the fact that there a few too
many open questions about how it should be implemented.

### Implementation phase

- [Issue #5016](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/5016):
  implement "dynamic drop" semantics using flags on the stack rather than zeroing
- [Issue #12634](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/12634):
  Replace various intrinsic wrappers with intrinsic reexports
- [Issue #15023](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15023):
  Better temporary lifetimes (tracking issue for RFC 66)
- [Issue #15287](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15287):
  Implement Pattern Guards with Bind-By-Move
- [Issue #20561](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20561):
  Tracking issue for Consistent no-prelude attribute (RFC 501)
- [Issue #27060](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060):
  repr(packed) allows invalid unaligned loads

### High priority issues

- [Issue #22889](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22889):
  Duplicate inherent static methods can be defined in separate `impl` blocks
- [Issue #29149](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29149):
  Lifetime bounds in Copy impls are ignored
- [Issue #29485](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29485):
  Unwinding through `fn()` references across crates causes the behavior to depend on the optimization level
- [Issue #29859](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29859):
  Cyclic traits allow arbitrary traits to be synthesized
- [Issue #30346](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30346):
  Re-add raw_pointer_derive lint as a no-op
- [Issue #30438](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30438):
  Segfault in safe code caused by a use after drop when using index sugar
- [Issue #30829](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/30829):
  Code no longer builds because of RFC 1214

### Needs decision
