# Subteam report: compiler 2015-08-07

## Dashboard

@arielb1 opened
[PR #27551](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27551), which
changes how structs and enums are represented in the compiler,
replacing various hashtables with a single `AdtDef` struct. This is a
reimplementation of a similar PR by @aatch. In addition to cleaner
code, it results in a small performance boost (approximately 5%).

There has been some progress towards removing drop flags. @pnkfelix
landed his "nonzeroing move hints" branch
([PR #26173](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26173)). Unfortunately,
some critical bugs were found shortly thereafter. The fix
([PR #27413](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27413)) is not yet
ready.
