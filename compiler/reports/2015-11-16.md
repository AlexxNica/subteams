# Subteam report: compiler 2015-11-16

## Highlights

The MIR transition has begun! Lately there have been a number of PRs
pushing on converting the `trans` phase over the compiler over to use
MIR, which is very exciting. If you're interesting in helping out,
please check out the
[MIR Tracking Issue #27840](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27840),
which contains a lot of links for bite-sized bits of work, as well as
larger design questions that are yet unsettled.
