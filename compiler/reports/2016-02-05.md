# Subteam report: compiler 2016-02-05

## Highlights

Panic handling in Windows has been undergoing serious improvement
lately. Alex Crichton landed
[PR #30448](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30448), which
enables support for Structured Exception Handling (SEH) on MSVC
targets. [PR #31313](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31313)
(still pending) will transition the `pc-windows-gnu` target as well.

On a less jolly note, two regressions in compiler performance were
recently reported. One has a fix pending, the other is still under
investigation:

- [#31157](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31157), which
  concerned complex uses of traits where we were doing less caching
  than before (fixed by
  [PR #31349](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31349)).
- We recently noticed a large drop in bootstrap time connected to a
  recent LLVM update. Investigation ongoing.
