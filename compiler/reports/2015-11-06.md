### Implementation phase

- [Issue #5016](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/5016):
  implement "dynamic drop" semantics using flags on the stack rather than zeroing
- [Issue #12634](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/12634):
  Replace various intrinsic wrappers with intrinsic reexports
- [Issue #15023](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15023):
  Better temporary lifetimes (tracking issue for RFC 66)
- [Issue #15287](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15287):
  Implement Pattern Guards with Bind-By-Move
- [Issue #20561](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20561):
  Tracking issue for Consistent no-prelude attribute (RFC 501)
- [Issue #27060](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060):
  repr(packed) allows invalid unaligned loads

### High priority issues

- [Issue #23880](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23880):
  Items with 'lexical' scope have poor scoping
- [Issue #26251](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26251):
  match expression falling through?
- [Issue #27060](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060):
  repr(packed) allows invalid unaligned loads
- [Issue #28325](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28325):
  Rules governing references to private types in public APIs not enforced in impls
- [Issue #28853](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28853):
   #28669 caused regression compiling pinyin crate on nightly
- [Issue #29053](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29053):
  Unsoundness in borrowck around deref and mutable refs
- [Issue #29149](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29149):
  Lifetime bounds in Copy impls are ignored
- [Issue #29466](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29466):
  Stack overflow when compiling lots of macros
- [Issue #29485](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29485):
  Unwinding through `fn()` references across crates causes the behavior to depend on the optimization level

### Needs decision
