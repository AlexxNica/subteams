# Subteam report: compiler 2016-02-12

## Highlights

No firm decisions were reached, but we discussed two topics of
general interest:

- RFCs [#1477] and [#1478], which discuss the intrinsics for doing
  atomic operations. At issue is what the behavior ought to be in the
  case of attempting to use the intrinsics with unsupported types --
  the current behavior is an LLVM abort, which seems suboptimal.
- [Whether or not to support MIR plugins][MIR]. Preliminary support
  landed in a recent PR, but it's unclear if we will ever want to
  support MIR plugins long-term (and it's certainly too early to offer
  even the faintest of stability promises).
