# Subteam report: community 2016-02-12

**This week's friend of the tree is Jeffrey Seyfried (@jseyfried)!**

Jeffrey Seyfried (@jseyfried) has made some awesome contributions to
name resolution. He has fixed a ton of bugs, reported previously
unknown edge cases, and done some big refactorings, all of which have
helped improve a complex and somewhat neglected part of the
compiler.
