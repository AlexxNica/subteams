# Subteam report: lang 2016-04-01

## Highlights

Due in part to missing team members, two RFCs that were already in FCP are
staying in FCP for another week:

- [FCP PR #1398](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1398):
  Allocators, take III
  - Left detailed comments
    [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1398#issuecomment-202998086)
    and summarized
    [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1398#issuecomment-204485595).
- [FCP PR #1513](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1513):
  RFC: Stabilize implementing panics as aborts

In addition, we reached final decisions on two long-standing FCP RFCs:

- [FCP PR #1321](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1321):
  Unstable visibility RFC
  - [Close](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1321#issuecomment-204500766).

- [FCP PR #1346](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1346):
  Unsafe expressions
  - [Close](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1346#issuecomment-204500410).

We also brought a couple of new RFCs into **final comment period**, leaving us
with the following list for the week:

- [FCP PR #1319](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1319):
  Amend RFC1228 with operator fixity and precedence
- [FCP PR #1373](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1373):
  Remove some kinds of doc comments
  - Proposes deprecating `#[doc=""]`, `#![doc=""]`, `/** */`, and `/*! */`.
- [FCP PR #1398](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1398):
  Allocators, take III
  - Proposes a comprehensive API for describing and using allocators, with the
    intent that types like `Vec` and `HashMap` can ultimately support custom
    allocators.
- [FCP PR #1444](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1444):
  unions
  - Proposes a C-like `union` keyword in Rust, useful for FFI as well as a few
    pure-Rust scenarios (like manually-dropped data).
- [FCP PR #1494](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1494):
  Amend RFC 550 with misc. follow set corrections
- [FCP PR #1513](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1513):
  RFC: Stabilize implementing panics as aborts
  - This RFC adds various options to allow the "end crate" (e.g., the
  application) to specify that panics ought to be compiled as aborts, rather
  than initiating unwinding. This is useful for applications that would prefer
  to crash the process, since supporting unwinding causes more code generation
  and can inhibit some optimizations.
  - The end-user model we are aiming towards with this RFC is that panics mean
    "abort and let somebody else handle it" -- in the case of unwinding, that
    "somebody else" may be another thread, but in the case of aborting, that
    "somebody else" is another process.
