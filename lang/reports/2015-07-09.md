# Subteam report: lang 2015-07-09

## Dashboard

It's been a few weeks since the last report. To be honest, though,
there hasn't been a lot of action in the language subteam, due to the
Mozilla work week, some vacations, and other factors.

This week, we'd like to move RFC #1150 into FCP:

- [FCP PR #1150](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1150): Allow
  re-exporting associated items with `use`.

This PR #873 about macros in types will remain in FCP for *one more
week* due to the fact that there was no time yet to talk it over in
depth. However, this will be the last week, or I will eat my hat (or
something):

- [FCP PR #873](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/873): Allow
  macros in types. There has been some discussion but no firm decision
  was reached.

Finally, the other RFC that was in FCP, #756, has been withdrawn.  The
topic was expanded sugar for closure expressions, and the judgement
was that there wasn't sufficient motivation to make the change at this
time. Perhaps later.
