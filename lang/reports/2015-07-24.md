# Subteam report: lang 2015-07-24

## Dashboard

Two decisions were made since the last report:

- RFC #873 (macros in types) was accepted.
- RFC #1150 (re-exporting associated iteams with `use`) was withdrawn.

One RFC is entering final comment period:

- RFC #1219: extending the `use` syntax to allow renaming in group
  imports.
- RFC #1214: clarifying rules for projections and well-formedness.
  This is a soundness RFC that clarifies some of the language rules,
  closing various soundness issues in the process. Some existing code
  may no longer compile (full evaluation in progress); in any case,
  the plan is to phase the changes in gradually.
  
Finally, we would like to call attention to one pending RFCs:

- RFC #1177: introducing an anonymous placeholder lifetime `'_`.
  There are some debates as to the best defaulting behavior and best
  syntax; more input would be helpful.

Thanks!
