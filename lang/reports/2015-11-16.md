# Subteam report: lang 2015-11-16

## Highlights

We decided to accept [RFC 1300] and [RFC 1268], though the latter has
some key implementation difficulties that will have to be resolved at
some point.

[RFC 1268]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1268
[RFC 1300]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1300

### High priority issues

- [Issue #25658](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25658):
  In macros, `$($x:expr),*` fragments can be used to bypass future-proofing restrictions
- [Issue #25860](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860):
  Implied bounds on nested references + variance = soundness hole

  `extern crate` is always treated as `pub` within the crate, but is not visible outside it; `pub extern crate` makes no difference
- [Issue #27060](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27060):
  repr(packed) allows invalid unaligned loads
- [Issue #28450](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28450):

### Needs decision

- [Issue #26502](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26502):
