# Subteam report: lang 2015-09-18

## Highlights

We decided to accept a number of RFCs:

- [RFC #1199](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1199): SIMD groundwork.
- [RFC #1224](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1224): RFC process.
- [RFC #1237](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1237): Clarify extreme operator behavior.
- [RFC #1238](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1238): Non-parametric dropck.
- [RFC #1240](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1240): References
  into packed structs should be unsafe.
  
We decided to place the following RFCs into **final comment period**:

- [RFC #1228](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1228): Change the
  "placement new" syntax from `in place { value }` to `place <-
  value`. The discussion has centered about what uses for "placement
  new" will be most common; this syntax seems well-suited to uses that
  do not yield a result, such as `vec <- elem`, and less well-suited
  to those that do, such as `let value = (arena <- value)`.
- [RFC #1245](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1245): Allow `const fn`
  functions to be `unsafe`.
  
Thanks!
