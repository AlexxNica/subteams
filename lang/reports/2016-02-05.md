# Subteam report: lang 2016-02-05

## Highlights

This week two RFCs were approved:

- [RFC #243][243], which adds the `?` suffix operator as a synonym for
  today's `try!` macro, and adds another construct `catch { }` that
  can be used to delimit the scope of the `?` operator. That is,
  whereas `try!` today always propagates errors out of the current
  function, the `catch {}` block allows the scope of the error to be
  restricted to something smaller.
- [RFC #1445][1445], which restricts the uses of constants of
  user-defined type in patterns to those types which are annotated
  with `#[derive(Eq)]`. The semantics of constants in patterns was
  never formally settled; this change adopts a common subset that
  everyone can agree on for the time being. The change has been tested
  using crater and was found to cause [6 regressions][crater] among the
  tested crates.
