# Subteam report: lang 2016-01-08

## Highlights

We decided to move [RFC #1331] into FCP. This RFC proposes to start
the development of an official Rust grammar and lays out a plan to get
there. (The RFC does not propose to autogenerate the Rust parser from
the grammar; that's an implementation detail in any case, better
suited to a compiler team RFC.) This is not expected to have any
direct impact on end-users, but is an important step towards
formalizing Rust's definition and specification.

We also recently discovered a flaw in the macro future-proofing RFC
([issue #30531]). This flaw means that otherwise legal changes to the
expression grammar (for example, the addition of type ascription) can
break macros "in the wild". We intend to close the flaw, but in the
meantime macro authors may want to review their macros to see if they
will be affected by upcoming grammar changes, such as type ascription
or the possible addition of a `?` operator. See [this comment]
for more details.
