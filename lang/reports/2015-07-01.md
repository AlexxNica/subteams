### Implementation phase


### High priority issues

- [Issue #24622](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24622):
  Mismatched assumptions for interaction between associated type and lifetime in trait
- [Issue #25310](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25310):
  Passing a `Fn` to an `fn` now requires explicit lifetimes for the `Fn` and all references passed to it when invoked
- [Issue #25658](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25658):
  In macros, `$($x:expr),*` fragments can be used to bypass future-proofing restrictions
- [Issue #25860](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860):
  Implied bounds on nested references + variance = soundness hole
- [Issue #26279](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26279):
  nightly rustc breaks stable code for some type inferences
