## Dashboard

The following RFCs are being promoted to **final comment period**:

- [PR #886](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/886): Permit
  `#[must_use]` attributes on functions as well as types. This allows
  for functions whose return value should not be ignored even if the
  type of that value is unexceptional (e.g., the `ok()` method of
  `Result`).
- [PR #890](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/890): Custom
  preludes.  This RFC proposes an extension that allows crates to
  define their own preludes. This can be used to have common names
  available throughout a crate without forcing them to be explicitly
  imported everywhere. This is particularly useful when combined with
  the convention of having external crates define a `pub mod prelude`
  that downstream crates can import into their own local
  preludes. While clearly convenient, there were some concerns raised
  that this will give rise to multiple dialects of Rust.
- [PR #953](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/953): This defines
  traits to support `+=` and other operators, closing a gap in our
  operator overloading support. The traits take the LHS via an `&mut`
  reference to permit in-place updates, take the RHS by value, and do
  not require that the `Add` trait also be implemented.
- [PR #1135](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1135): This PR
  permits raw fat pointers (e.g., `*[i32]` or `*Trait`) to be
  compared, just like raw thin pointer (e.g., `*i32`). The semantics
  are to compare both the pointer itself *and* any accompanying data
  (e.g., the length of the slice).
- [PR #1192](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1192): Adds
  syntactic sugar for inclusive ranges using `...`. The primary point
  of discussion has been whether the result of `...` syntax should be
  an iterator, like `..`; doing so requires an extra field.
- [PR #1189](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1189): This PR
  simply corrects typos. 

The following two RFCs have been accepted:

- [PR #1214](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1214): Clarify
  (and improve) rules for projections and well-formedness.
- [PR #1219](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1219): Allow
  aliasing imports when importing as a group.
  
In addition, I would like to call attention to the following RFC:

- [PR #1238](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1238):
  Nonparametric dropck. This RFC simplifies the dropck rules to close
  some soundness holes and make room for specialization. The change is
  expected to cause little to no breakage in practice, e.g., a crater
  run found no affected crates, but it nonetheless affects a core
  component of the language.
