## Highlights

Three RFCs went into final comment period this week:

- [RFC 243](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/243#issuecomment-172057844),
  which adds a `?` operator that is roughly equivalent to the existing
  `try!` macro, except that it operates in suffix position. The scope
  of the `?` operator can be controlled using a `try { ... }` block
  and there is also sugar for handling errors `try { .. } catch {
  .. }`. This RFC has been around since before 1.0, and has seen quite
  a lot of discussion. (Note that the `try` and `catch` keywords are
  [likely to change](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/243#issuecomment-164857624),
  given the overlap with the existing `try!` macro.
- [RFC 1320](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1320) which modifies
  the `RangeInclusive` type from a struct to an enum.
- [RFC 1462](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1462), which adds
  the open brace character to the follow set for type fragments.  This
  macro is taking a "fast path" to FCP due to the time-sensitive
  nature of its contents -- it is intended to mitigate the effects of
  a recent bugfix.

We are seeking feedback on
[the name and syntax for so-called OIBIT traits](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-renaming-oibits-and-changing-their-declaration-syntax/3086),
such as `Send` and `Sync`.

Finally, we've decided to accept [RFC 1331](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1331),
which spells out a procedure for making an official Rust grammar
that is independent from the implementation.

Thanks!
