## Highlights

The following RFCs are entering **final comment period**:

- [PR #1131](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1131):
  Add an expect intrinsic.
- [PR #1052](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1052):
  Clarify cast rules, especially regarding fat pointers.
  - Extended from last week.

Last week, we moved a number of RFCs into the final comment period:

- [PR #1052](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1052):
  Clarify cast rules, especially regarding fat pointers.
  - No decision. FCP has been extended to give time for more discussion
    on some of the finer points.
- [PR #1096](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1096):
  remove static_assert.
  - *Accepted*, tracking issue #24910.
- [PR #982](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/982):
  DST custom coercions.
  - *Accepted*, tracking issue #18469. Note that much of this
    implementation has been done, but the design is not considered
    fully stabilized.
- [PR #591](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/591):
  Sizeof, alignof, offsetof, typeof
  - *Postponed* as issue [#1144] to allow room to explore a variant
    based on associated constants.
- [PR #948](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/948):
  Retire RFC 8 (intrinsics) without implementing it.
  - *Accepted*.

I'd also like to highlight [PR 25796], by @arielb1, which implemented
defaults for associated types. Nice!

[PR 25796]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25796 
[#1144]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1144

### Implementation phase


### High priority issues

- [Issue #25310](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25310):
  Passing a `Fn` to an `fn` now requires explicit lifetimes for the `Fn` and all references passed to it when invoked
- [Issue #25860](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860):
  Implied bounds on nested references + variance = soundness hole

### Needs decision
