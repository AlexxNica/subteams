# Subteam report: lang 2016-03-25

## Highlights

We promoted some exciting RFCs to FCP this week:

- [RFC #1398][]: Custom allocator traits. These are traits
  intended to eventually be used to customize e.g. what allocator
  a `Vec` uses. (In collaboration with libs team.)
- [RFC #1513][]: Stabilize implementing panics as aborts. This RFC
  adds various options to allow the "end crate" (e.g., the
  application) to specify that panics ought to be compiled as aborts,
  rather than initiating unwinding. This is useful for applications
  that would prefer to crash the process, since supporting unwinding
  causes more code generation and can inhibit some optimizations.
  - The end-user model we are aiming towards with this RFC is that
    panics mean "abort and let somebody else handle it" -- in the case
    of unwinding, that "somebody else" may be another thread, but in
    the case of aborting, that "somebody else" is another process.
