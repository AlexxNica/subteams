# Subteam report: lang 2015-08-14

## Highlights

The following RFCs were promoted to **final comment period**:

- [RFC #1229](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1229), which
  specifies that when the compiler is doing constant evaluation as a
  form of optimization, it should not report compilation errors for
  overflows or other problems that are encountered (warnings are ok).
  Otherwise, improvements in the constant evaluator can become
  breaking changes.
- [RFC #1234](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1234), which
  modifies the DST coercion rules to permit `PhantomData`. The
  discussion has primarily focused on whether we can indeed make the
  rules even more accepting than that; conclusion was to leave this
  for future work.

Some fine fellow (*ahem*) also started a scintillating discussion on
the interaction of type parameter fallback with integral fallback
started on internals, which would benefit from more eyeballs:

- [Interaction of user-defined and integral fallbacks with inference][1]

[1]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/interaction-of-user-defined-and-integral-fallbacks-with-inference/2496

Last week, we had a number of RFCs enter FCP. Unfortunately, we did
not reach final decisions on very many of them, due to Felix Klock
being out for some well-earned R&R. However, we did merge a few
noncontroversial items:

- [RFC #1209](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1209) updates
  the follow set for types in macros to include `;`.
- [RFC #1189](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1189) fixes
  some typos.
  
We also decided to close several RFCs for prioritization reasons, even
if the ideas espoused had merit:

- [RFC 886](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/886), allowing
  "must use" on functions (by @huonw).
- [RFC 890](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/890), custom
  preludes (by @aturon).
- [RFC 1216](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216), promote `!`
  to a type (by @canndrew).
