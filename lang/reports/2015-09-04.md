## Highlights

It's been a busy week this week! First off, we accepted a number of
RFCs:

- [RFC #953](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/953) -- overloaded `+=` etc
- [RFC #1135](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1135) -- raw fat pointer comparisons
- [RFC #1192](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1192) -- inclusive ranges
- [RFC #1229](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1229) -- overflow in constant evaluation
- [RFC #1234](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1234) -- `CoerceUnsized` and `PhantomData`

We also moved a number of RFCs to **final comment period**:

- [RFC #1199](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1199) -- SIMD
  groundwork, which describes a flexible set of intrinsics that enable
  SIMD computation. These intrinsics are not intended to be used
  directly; rather, they are meant to be a foundation for third-party
  packages.  See also Huon's
  [excellent blog post on the topic](http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/08/simd-in-rust/).
- [RFC #1224](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1224) -- RFC process,
  which helps to clarify when an RFC is needed. 
- [RFC #1237](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1237) -- clarify
  operator behavior in extreme conditions, which amends the overflow
  RFC with some more specifics documenting various bits of the implementation.
- [RFC #1238](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1238) --
  nonparametric dropck, which reverts some of the more subtle aspects
  of the current dropck rules, helping to restore soundness and pave
  the way for specialization.
- [RFC #1240](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1240) -- creating
  references into `#[repr(packed)]` structs should be unsafe, as they
  can violate alignment requirements and cause crashes.
  
Thanks!
