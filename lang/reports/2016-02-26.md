# Subteam report: lang 2016-02-26

## Highlights

We've reached decisions on some longstanding RFCs:

- [FCP PR #1210](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210):
  RFC: impl specialization
  - Accepted, with a [detailed summary by @nikomatsakis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210#issuecomment-187777838)

- [FCP PR #1303](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1303):
  Add a `let...else` expression, similar to Swift's `guard let...else`
  - Closed as postponed.

In addition, we've reached some stabilization decisions:

- [FCP PR  #28235](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28235):
  Tracking issue for overloaded `+=` operators (RFC 953) (feature augmented_assignments)
  - Stabilize.

- [FCP PR  #29720](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29720):
  Tracking issue for `braced_empty_structs` (RFC 218)
  - Stabilize.

We spent the rest of our time making decisions on various outstanding PRs and
issues, as per usual.

Next week, we will decide which language features to consider for stabilization
in Rust 1.9. Please take a look at the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AB-unstable+label%3AT-lang)
for candidates for stabilization, and leave comments on any that you'd like to
nominate.
