## Highlights

It was a busy week this week for FCP. We decided to promote four
RFCs to FCP:

- **[RFC #1201][]: Add support for naked functions.** This RFC allows
  functions to be declared as "naked", meaning that the compiler will
  generate no prologue or epilog. This is a low-level feature that can
  be useful when writing kernels or other such software.
- **[RFC #1422][]: pub(restricted) item.** An extension to our privacy
  system that allows a wider range of public/private declarations.
  Instead of merely declaring items as "public to everyone" or
  "private to the current module", one can now declare items as
  "public to the current crate" (but not other crates) or "public to
  some module M" (where M is some enclosing module). This helps in
  particular to alleviate "private type in public API" errors.
- **[RFC #1346][]: unsafe expressions.** The proposal is to
  permit `unsafe expr` (without braces) rather than just
  `unsafe { block }`.
- **[RFC #1321][]: unstable visibility.** The proposal is to
  change how unstable methods interact with method dispatch.

In addition, the following unstable language feature is being placed
in FCP. As a reminder, FCPs for unstable language features last an
**entire release cycle**, at the end of which we will typically decide to
either remove the language feature, or else stabilize it (though we may
elect to defer a final decision):

- [#29636][]: The `#[macro_reexport]` attribute, which allows you to
  take macros from an `extern crate` and re-export them. This is
  roughly the equivalent of a `pub use` from the other crate, but for
  macros.

Thanks!
