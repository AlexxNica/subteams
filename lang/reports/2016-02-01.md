# Subteam report: lang 2016-02-01

## Highlights

This week we discussed and made decisions on several nominated issues and PRs, including:

- Remove volatile semantics for atomics (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/30962)
  - Merge, perhaps while adding additional operations with volatile semantics.
- Loosen restriction around `use`/`extern crate` in blocks (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31144)
  - Merge, consider lint in the long run.
- Accessing variants through a type alias (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31179)
  - Close; given some of the tricky questions that have come up, we'd like an RFC here.
- Unsafely ascribe `'static` bounds (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31196)
  - Close in favor of an RFC.

We reached a
[basic decision](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/243#issuecomment-177045710)
on the `?`/`try`/`catch` RFC, which is that we plan to merge the
RFC. However, there remains some bikeshedding to be done, so we will
have one more week of FCP to sort out the keywords:

- [FCP PR #243](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/243):
  Trait-based exception handling

We moved two features into final comment period (FCP) for stabilization in Rust 1.8:

- [FCP Issue #28235](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28235):
  Tracking issue for overloaded `+=` operators (RFC 953) (feature augmented_assignments)
- [FCP Issue #29720](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29720):
  Tracking issue for `braced_empty_structs` (RFC 218)

Finally, we brought two RFCs into final comment period (FCP):

- [FCP PR #1210](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210):
  RFC: impl specialization
- [FCP PR #1445](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1445):
  Restrict constants in patterns
