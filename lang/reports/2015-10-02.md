# Subteam report: lang 2015-10-02

## Highlights

This is a relatively quiet week, since nrc was out. We did, however,
decide to place [RFC #1260][] into FCP. This RFC concerns allowing the
use of a re-export for the `main` function. We also decided to accept
[RFC #1245][], which permits `const fn` functions to be declared
`unsafe`.
