# Subteam report: lang 2016-05-02

## Highlights

In this week's meeting, we promoted two RFCs to FCP:

- [RFC 1492][] proposes to permit `..` notation in patterns as a more
  general replacement to `_`, so that one can write a pattern like
  `Foo(x, ..)` instead of `Foo(x, _, _, _)`.
- [RFC 1592][] is a small amendment that corrects an oversight in the
  original well-formedness RFC, by making tuples require that all
  elements except for the last element be `Sized` (just as structs
  do).
  
In addition, [RFC 1358][] remains in FCP for another week as we
discuss the precise interaction between custom alignment and packed
structs.  It seems that there is a
[difference in behavior between MSVC and GNU][c] and it's not entirely
clear which behavior to adopt.
