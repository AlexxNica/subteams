# Subteam report: lang 2016-01-22

## Highlights

We've decided to accept two RFCs this week, [RFC 1320][] and
[RFC 1462][]. Both are small tweaks to existing RFCs. We decided to
extend the FCP period for RFC 243 (`try` and `?`) because there was
still some ongoing discussion. That's it!

### High priority issues

  Private trait's methods reachable through a public subtrait
- [Issue #29149](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29149):

### Needs decision
