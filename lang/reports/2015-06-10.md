# Subteam report: lang 2015-06-10

The following RFCs are entering **final comment period**:

- [PR #1156](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1156):
  Adjust default object bounds. *(breaking change)*
  - Since time is of the essence here, this RFC is being
    promoted to FCP immediately.
  - This is a *breaking change* that is being suggested because the
    current defaults have some shortcomings that seem worth
    correcting, and all evidence indicates that making this change
    will have negligible impact (details are in the RFC) in existing
    code. This would be an exception from normal policy.
  - Some prior discussion took place in a
    [thread on internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-adjust-default-object-bounds/2199/).
- [PR #873](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/873):
  Allow macros in types
- [PR #865](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/865):
  Amendment to associated items RFC to account for the const/static split.
- [PR #756](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/756):  
  Allow closure expressions to expand to a `&` or `&mut` temporary

The following RFCs have been around a long time without much
action. It is not clear whether we are ready to reach a final
decision, but I'd like to encourage comments. These RFCs are likely to
enter FCP next week.

- [PR #197](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/197):
  `ManuallyDrop` trait, which allows types to disable the
  "automatic drop" their inline content that currently occurs.
- [PR #638](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/638):
  Specifies behavior during unwinding, particularly with respect
  to non-Rust code.
- [PR #890](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/890):
  RFC: Custom preludes.

Last week we moved a number of RFCs into the final comment
period. Here is the outcome:

- [PR #1131](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1131):
  Add an expect intrinsic.
  - Approved.
- [PR #1052](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1052):
  Clarify cast rules, especially regarding fat pointers.
  - Still hammering out final details.
- [PR #1122](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1122):
  Semantic versioning for the language.
  - Approved.
- [PR #987](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/987):
  Modify RFC #803 (type ascription) to make type ascription expressions lvalues
  - Approved.

### Implementation phase


### High priority issues

- [Issue #24622](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24622):
  Mismatched assumptions for interaction between associated type and lifetime in trait
- [Issue #25310](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25310):
  Passing a `Fn` to an `fn` now requires explicit lifetimes for the `Fn` and all references passed to it when invoked
- [Issue #25658](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25658):
  In macros, `$($x:expr),*` fragments can be used to bypass future-proofing restrictions
- [Issue #25860](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860):
  Implied bounds on nested references + variance = soundness hole
