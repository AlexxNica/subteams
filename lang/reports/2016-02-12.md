## Highlights

"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice." -- Rush

This week we decided to postpone two RFCs that have been lingering in
final comment period for some time:

- [RFC #1129], which added a special overload for `map[key] = value`
  syntax.  There were [concerns][concerns-1196] about the
  implementation complexity and the general proliferation of ways to
  insert into maps, particularly if [emplacement syntax][] becomes
  more mainstream. Hence we decided to postpone until we've had a
  chance to push harder on emplacement syntax.
- [RFC #1196], which allowed eliding type parameters and which filled
  in the results with `_`. Here the [concerns][concerns-1196] were
  about the interaction with the inference fallbacks that were
  described in [RFC 213][] (but never fully implemented).
  [The decision][decision-1196] was to postpone the RFC in favor of a
  broader discussion that tries to capture the full set of
  constraints.
