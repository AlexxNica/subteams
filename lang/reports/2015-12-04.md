# Subteam report: lang 2015-12-04

## Highlights

We have decided to promote the following RFCs to **final comment period**:

- [RFC #1384](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1384): This RFC
  amends RFC 550 to includ an abstract specification rather than an
  algorithm. It is the result of revisiting the code in light of
  numerous bugs that were uncovered in practice. **Note that fixing
  these bugs is known to break some macros that were found in the
  wild.** Macro authors may wish to read the RFC, or at least look at
  the list of [regressions found on crater][regr]. (Note that we also
  plan to amend RFC 550 to be more accepting so to avoid most of those
  regressions.)

We did not reach firm decisions on the two pending FCP RFCs; but we
discussed a number of aspects and posted lengthy comments with our
tentative conclusions ([#1129] and [#1196]).

*Note:* Next week is Mozilla's company wide "all hands" work week, so
we may or may not have a meeting and will likely not have any subteam
report.
