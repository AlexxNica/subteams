# Subteam report: tools 2015-12-04

## Highlights

With Thanksgiving last week and the 1.5 release just around the corner this was
a quiet few weeks for the tools team, but that doesn't mean exciting things
weren't happening!

* @brson's been working on getting a port of Rust to work with Emscripten, and
  initial results are promising with "hello world" already working!
* Support [has landed in Cargo][cargo1] to allow build scripts to explicitly
  specify their file dependencies. This should reduce the number of rebuilds
  seen because Cargo reruns a build script.
* The libc crate [now tests against rumprun][libc1], becoming the first
  BSD platform to have automation verifying the definitions in libc.
* The deadline for returning a hard error from publishing crates with a wildcard
  version [has been pushed back][cratesio1] as the Cargo warning will be
  released with 1.5.
