# Subteam report: tools 2015-09-04

## Highlights

Over the past month or so since our last report there have been some excellent
tooling updates, I'll try to list a bunch below but if any are left out please
let me know and I'll be sure to add them!

* Custom allocators [have landed][alloc], allowing projects to customize
  precisely which allocator is in use for the compiled binary. This also affects
  static and dynamic libraries which now use the system allocator by default
  (Rust binaries continue to use jemalloc by default).
* Our bundled version of Hoedown [was upgraded][hoedown] to fix a bug where you
  couldn't have a `|` character in a table cell.
* The standard library [now compiles and passes many tests][android-x86] on a
  new `i686-linux-android` target.
* [New snapshots][dragonfly-snap] for DragonFly were registered to allow
  bootstrapping the platform again.
* The [initial pass of the HIR][hir] has landed, paving the way for future
  tooling using the compiler!
* [rustfmt is being used][rustfmt] on a few modules in the compiler to test it
  out.
* crates.io [now supports GitHub teams][crates-io-teams] for specifying those
  who can publish a crate.
* The `--manifest-path` option to some Cargo subcommands [has been made more
  consistent][cargo-manifest-path] in its behavior.
* `cargo update` [now prints][cargo-update] what was updated.
