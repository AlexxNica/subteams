# Subteam report: tools 2015-10-16

## Highlights

A relatively quiet few weeks, but lost of stuff coming up on the horizon!

* @nrc [has been leading the charge][rustfmt] of using [rustfmt][fmt-repo] to
  format a number of files in the rust-lang/rust repo and surrounding
  repositories.
* @edunham, @brson, and @alexcrichton spent the past week preparing Buildbot,
  rust-packaging, rust-installer, rustup, multirust, and the main repository for
  producing cross-compilers. While not rolled out to prod just yet, soon it will
  be much easier to download the standard library for architectures like ARM,
  AArch64, MIPS, MUSL, Android, iOS, etc.
* The definition of Rust's "tiers of support" are [being fleshed out][tiers]
