# Subteam report: tools 2015-07-09

This week the tools team picked [up one RFC][pr-1193] which should help mitigate
upstream breakage from the compiler updating lints. Cargo has a number of
outstanding PRs for new features such as [`cargo run --with`][cargo-with],
[project templates][cargo-templates], and [running cargo
concurrently][cargo-lock]. Emily has also [performed an analysis][packaging] of
the packaging status for Rust across various Linux distributions, and it looks
like we've got our work cut out for ourselves!

On the MSVC front [the compiler will now probe for `link.exe`][msvc-1] and has
briefly turned unwinding on by default, but this will likely [be turned back off
soon][msvc-2]. The [codegen-units option][msvc-3] now works on MSVC, though!
