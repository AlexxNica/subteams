## Highlights

* The `rustfmt` tool [has moved to `rust-lang-nursery`][rustfmt], and be sure to
  keep an eye on it as it's likely to move to `rust-lang` one day as well!
* Cargo has grown a new [`cargo rustdoc` command][cargo-rustdoc] similar to
  `cargo rustc`.
* The [community page on the website][community] has seen some excellent edits.
* Some amazing work has gone into [updating crates.io's ember.js dep][emberup]
  along with fixing a few longstanding issues.
