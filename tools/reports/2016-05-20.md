# Subteam report: tools 2016-05-20

## Highlights

* An excellent [blog post about rustup][rustup] was published, detailing the
  vision for the tool and next steps.
* Custom panic runtimes [are now implemented][panicabort] which means that the
  compiler flag `-C panic=abort` can now be use to implement panics as aborts.
* The new rust build system [can now run crate tests][rustbuild] which should
  bring it up to feature parity for tier 1 platforms.
* Various Android targets have [seen][android1] [updates][android2] to enable
  more features and align them with the upstream definitions.
* A new crate type, `cdylib`, is [now available][cdylib] for production by the
  compiler which is optimized for producing a dynamic library with a C API.
  More information can be found in the [relevant RFC][rfc].
* Cargo will [now retry][retry] failed network requests by default if they look
  like they're spurious failures.
* Cargo will [now emit status to stderr][stderr] instead of stdout.
