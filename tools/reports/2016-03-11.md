# Subteam report: tools 2016-03-11

## Highlights

The major highlight of this week was Multirust 0.8 [was released][multirust]
with cross-std installation support! The [multirust-rs] project is also rapidly
approaching parity and will likely soon outpace multirust.sh in terms of
features, more info on this over the next few weeks!

Some other notable PRs against Rust and Cargo were:

* The rustbuild build system [can now bootstrap][bootstrap] non-build-triple
  compilers, for example meaning an `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` compiler can
  easily be built.
* Work continues on the [emscripten][emscripten1] [port][emscripten2] and it now
  sports rustbuild support!
* Cargo now [only downloads what's required][cargo-download] to complete a
  build.
* Cargo now supports [`--limit` to the `cargo search` command][cargo-search] to
  show more or fewer search results.
