# Subteam report: tools 2015-10-02

## Highlights

Some exciting developments happened in the past few weeks on the tooling and
infrastructure point, here's some of the highlights:

* [Basic NetBSD/amd64][netbsd] has landed in the compiler.
* [Support for a `target_vendor`][vendor] `cfg` option was added and then used
  to [add support for rumprun][rumprun].
* [A linkage issue with MSVC][msvc-link] was fixed, one of the last few
  remaining issues to a smooth MSVC experience!
* [Cargo now warns][cargo-warn] about `*` dependencies when publishing a crate
  in accordance with [RFC 1241][rfc-1241].
* [Cargo now accepts][cargo-p] multiple `-p` parameters to all of its commands
  to allow operations such as testing multiple packages in one go.
* [multirust now has Windows support][multirust] through an MSYS shell, and soon
  there may even be a [Rust version of multirust][multirust-rs]!
