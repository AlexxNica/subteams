# Subteam report: tools 2016-05-08

## Highlights

A relatively quiet few weeks with regards to tooling and infrastructure, but
some of the highlights were:

* A [new approach][errors] has landed in the compiler and [feedback would be
  most welcome][feedback]!
* The `target_env` value for many Linux ARM targets [has been
  normalized][musl-or-gnu] to just "gnu".
* Nightlies for [i686 FreeBSD Cargo][free32] are now available.
* A new [`--force` flag][force] for `cargo install` is now available to
  overwrite existing binaries.
* The [RFC for Cargo workspaces][workspaces] has been accepted.
