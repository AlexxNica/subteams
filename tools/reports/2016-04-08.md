# Subteam report: tools 2016-04-08

## Highlights

* [rustup], the successor to [multirust], is now available for [beta
  testing][rustup-beta]. Please feel free to leave feedback on the [internals
  thread][rustup-beta]!
* Nightlies for the `i586-pc-windows-msvc` target [are now being produced][i586].
* Nightly for the `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` target [are now being
  produced][arm64].
* Top level overrides in Cargo [have landed][overrides], allowing you to specify
  package overrides in `Cargo.toml` to work with other collaborators.
* The following RFCs have been moved into their **final comment period** to be
  decided upon ~2 weeks from now:

  * [RFC 1510] - Adding a new `rdylib` crate type. Note that we are specifically
    interested in hearing about `dylib` use cases today to see if changing its
    definition will cause breakage.
  * [RFC 1525] - Adding workspaces to Cargo
  * [RFC 1535] - Stabilizing `-C overflow-checks` as a flag
