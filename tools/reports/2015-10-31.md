## Friend of the Tree

Today @nrc would like to nominated @marcusklaas as Friend of the Tree:

Marcus is one of the primary authors of
[rustfmt](https://github.com/nrc/rustfmt). He has been involved since the early
days and is now the [top
contributor](https://github.com/nrc/rustfmt/graphs/contributors). He has fixed
innumerable bugs, implemented new features, reviewed a tonne of PRs, and
contributed to the design of the project. Rustfmt would not be the software it
is today without his hard work; he is indeed a Friend Of The Tree.

## Highlights

Some highlights from the past two weeks:

* Rust 1.4 [was released][rust14]! Thanks again to brson for putting together
  the release notes and to steveklabnik for writing the release announcement!
* [`cargo install` has been implemented][cargo-install] and is available on the
  beta/nightly channels of Rust. More information can be found [in the
  RFC][install-rfc].
* [`rustfmt` continues to make progress][rustfmt] now being amenable to `cargo
  install` and compiling on stable Rust.
