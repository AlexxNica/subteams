# Subteam report: tools 2016-01-30

## Highlights

This was a busy past few weeks for the tools in Rust, especially in the realm of
Cargo!

* An [initial port][ppc] for powerpc64 and powerpc64le targets has been added.
* Static libraries and import libraries for MSVC [have been
  renamed][msvc-rename] to have more conventional names on Windows.
* Binaries on Linux and BSDs [now have the NX bit set][nx]. This brings these
  platforms in line with the behavior on Windows and OSX.
* A new [`cargo init` subcommand][cargo-init] has been implemented to initialize
  pre-existing Rust projects with Cargo configuration.
* A new [`cargo metadata` subcommand][cargo-metadata] has been implemented to
  learn about a Cargo project through the CLI via JSON output.
* The meaning of [`cargo install`][cargo-install] as a plain command has been
  changed to install the current crate (e.g. the one at `$PWD`).
* A new [`project.publish` key in Cargo.toml][cargo-private] has been added to
  indicate that a crate cannot be published to crates.io.
