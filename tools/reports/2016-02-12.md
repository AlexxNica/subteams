# Subteam report: tools 2016-02-12

## Highlights

The past few weeks saw the merging of [RFC 1361][rfc1361] which will improve the
target-specific dependencies syntax in Cargo. Additionally, lots of effort has
ramped up on the [multirust-rs] project in preparation for it taking over
`multirust.sh` as well as `rustup.sh`.

Notable Rust PRs:

* Support for MIPS MUSL [has landed][mips-musl].
* Backtrace support on MSVC [has been improved][msvc-backtrace].
* Initial support for Illumos [has landed][illumos].
* Initial support for emscripten [has landed][illumos], and ongoing PRs are
  happening to get more tests passing.
* Rustdoc [will now display][rustdoc-since] `since` to show when APIs first
  became available.
* The beginnings of a new build system based on Cargo [have landed][rustbuild].
* The compiler flag `-C link-dead-code` [was added][link-dead] to aid in
  generating coverage information.

Notable Cargo PRs:

* The default build target [can now be set][build-target] through
  `build.target` in `.cargo/config`.
* The `cargo metadata` subcommand [gained a `--no-deps` flag][no-deps] to
  eventually replace `cargo read-manifest`.
* Cargo on Windows [will now ensure][cargo-jobs] that child processes (tests,
  rustc, etc) will die when Cargo dies (e.g. via ctrl-c)
