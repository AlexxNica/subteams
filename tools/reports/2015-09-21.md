## Highlights

Some of the highlights from the past two weeks:

* [MSVC backtraces][msvc-backtrace] now have line numbers where possible.
* [LLVM has been updated][llvm-37] to the 3.7 release branch.
* OpenBSD has [a snapshot][openbsd-snap] and [a][openbsd-fix3]
  [few][openbsd-fix1] [fixes][openbsd-fix2] so it's almost passing tests and
  "vanilla bootstrapping".
* [1.3 was released][rust-13], be sure to thank @brson for his awesome work in
  preparing all the artifacts!
* There's a [thread on internals][packaging] about packaging Rust and Cargo
  with lots of good discussion.
* A [new RFC has been proposed][test-machine] for adding machine readable output
  to the test harness that rustc generates.
