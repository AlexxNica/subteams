# Subteam report: tools 2015-12-18

## Highlights

#### Rust 1.5 Released!

Although the [actual release][release] was last week, it's worth giving extra
thanks to @brson again for prep'ing the release and make sure all the artifacts
are in order!

[release]: http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/12/10/Rust-1.5.html

#### Rustfmt

There's been steady progress on Rustfmt, it's now a very capable tool -
indicated by it's recent promotion to the rust-lang-nursery repo. You should
try it out, and doing so is now easier than ever thanks to some recent PRs from
the community:

```
# To install
cargo install rustfmt
# To run on a Cargo project
cargo fmt
```

Or check out the source code at https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt

#### Refactoring

Garming Sam (@GSam) has been working on a refactoring tool for Rust. Adolfo
Ochagav√≠a (@aochagavia) will be working on more refactorings for his final year
project next year and has already got stuck in with a big PR bringing the code
up to date. Check out the source at https://github.com/GSam/rust-refactor.

#### Macros

Daniel Campbell is conducting a summer research project on improving Rust's
tool support for macros. This is mainly focused on compiler support. The first
visible changes will be making DXR macro-aware. This work will be useful in the
future for IDE support and static analysis tools.

#### Benchmarking compile time

If you're interested in our compile times, check out
http://www.ncameron.org/perf-rustc/. We're tracking compile time and memory use
for every phase of compilation on a number of benchmarks and the compiler
bootstrap.

#### Landed PRs

* The Windows SDK detection code [has been updated][winsdk] to more closely
  match what VS does and work with the newest release of VS.
* [Better support for `--llvm-root`][llvmroot] has been implemented, so custom
  LLVM installations with odd configurations should work more robustly.

[llvmroot]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27937
