# Subteam report: tools 2015-08-14

## Highlights

These past two weeks saw a number of exciting events!

* Rust 1.2 [was released][rust-12], thanks to @brson for doing the release
  process!
* The main site is now [hosted over https][https] thanks to @edunham's move from
  GitHub pages to Cloudfront!
* [`make check` is now running][make-check] for 64-bit MSVC. This means that all
  changes to the compiler must pass all tests on MSVC to land! Note that this is
  enabled by [turning on unwinding][unwinding] for 64-bit MSVC which is in turn
  enabled by @vadimcn's [awesome work][winexn] on unwinding.
* The [`cargo install` RFC][cargo-install] has been merged.
* @brson has [released a tool][crusader] for testing whether publishing your
  crate would cause a regression on reverse dependencies.
* multirust has gained [a `which` command][mr-which] to locate where binaries
  are, thanks to @shaleh!
