# Subteam report: tools 2015-06-16

## Highlights

This was another quiet week for the tools team, but there were a number of
advances made on the MSVC front:

* All rust-lang crates now have CI on MSVC as well as MinGW (using AppVeyor)
* A successful Cargo build [using MSVC][cargo-msvc] has been produced, which
  primarily involved ensuring all native dependencies work with MSVC (e.g.
  libssh2, libgit2, libcurl, miniz, ...).
* The [update for llvm][llvm-update] has finally landed, enabling work to
  continue on implementing unwinding for MSVC!

[cargo-msvc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1724
[llvm-update]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26025

This past week also saw a number of improvements for Cargo land on nightly:

* Support for a shared target directory was improved by [fixing][target-dir-1]
  [a][target-dir-2] [number][target-dir-3] of bugs.
* Cargo now [compiles with stable Rust 1.1][cargo-stable].
* ZSH completion [has been fixed][cargo-zsh].
