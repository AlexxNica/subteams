# Subteam report: tools 2015-07-24

## Highlights

It's been a bit since the last report, so here's some of the highlights over the
past two weeks:

* 32-bit MSVC nightlies are [now available][32-msvc]
* The [`--cap-lints` RFC was merged][cap-lints-merge] and [a PR was
  posted][cap-lints-pr]
* Travis CI is now used [more aggressively][travis] on the main repo thanks to
  @Gankro
* @vadimcn [has done some great work][unwind-seh] to help bring unwinding to
  64-bit MSVC soon.
* @michaelwoerister has gotten [MSVC debuginfo working][windows-debug]
* [LLVM was updated][llvm-update] to enable 32-bit MSVC to bootstrap and LLVM's
  archive support is leveraged on more platforms instead of using the system
  `ar`.
* @dhuseby has taken over the FreeBSD bots and snapshots will soon be registered
  to get them green again!

In other news the [`cargo install` RFC][cargo-install] is likely to go into FCP
soon, so be sure to keep an eye on it!
