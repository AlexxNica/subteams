# Subteam report: tools 2015-11-07

## Highlights

This week saw a number of changes on Windows, including a
[slight change to the directory layout][windist],
[building compiler-rt with MSVC][comprt-msvc], and
[no longer depending on libgcc on GNU builds][wingnu].
In other news rustdoc also [no longer warns when documenting][rustdoc-warn] and
the tools team in conjunction with the lang team have decided to move [RFC
1296][rfc] into its **final comment period**.
