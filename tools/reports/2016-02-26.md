## Friend of the Tree

This week I'd like to nominated @mitaa as Friend of the Tree. Recently @mitaa
[has][rd1] [went][rd2] [a][rd3] [wave][rd4] [of][rd5] [fixes][rd6]
[to][rd7] [rustdoc][rd8] (yes those are all separate links) with even more on
the way! Rustdoc has historically been a tool in need of some love, and the
extra help in fixing bugs is especially appreciated. Thanks @mitaa!

## Highlights

* The compiler [now supports][print-targets] a `--print target-list` flag to
  print out all supported targets the compiler can generate code for.
* A new [i586-unknown-linux-gnu target][i586] is available for older 32-bit x86
  CPUs.
* The jemalloc build on linux [is now longer prefixed][jemalloc-unprefix],
  giving a nice small perf improvement now that LLVM is using jemalloc.
* Cargo [now supports target-specific-dependencies][cargo-target] via
  `#[cfg]`-like syntax.
* Cargo [now reads][cargo-config] configuration generically from environment
  variables in addition to `.cargo/config` locations.
