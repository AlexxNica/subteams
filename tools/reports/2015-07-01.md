# Subteam report: tools 2015-07-01

## Highlights

This past week the Rust team was at the Mozilla Work Week where a number of
meaty tooling-related topics were discussed including cross compilation,
distribution of artiacts, online installers, and `cargo install`. Keep your eyes
peeled for a `cargo install` RFC coming soon!

Otherwise this past week there were a number of exciting changes to Cargo made:

* [A --quiet flag][q-flag] was added to all subcommands
* [Command output][escape] is now escaped for a shell
* [MSVC nightlies][msvc-cargo] are now available

[q-flag]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1748
[escape]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1770
[msvc-cargo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1757

In other news we now have combined Rust/Cargo installers for MSVC 64 bit Windows
being built on a nightly basis now! The URLs are:

* https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
* https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.msi

If you're interested in checking out the MSVC support of the compiler, please
take these for a spin and report any bugs! Keep in mind that unwinding is not
yet turned on (so destructors on panics won't run), but everything else should
be basically working (modulo small bugs).
