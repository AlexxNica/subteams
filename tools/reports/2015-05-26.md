## Highlights

Here at the start we have only a handful of RFCs, but there is quite a lot of
pending work and future projects to get the ball rolling on throughout the rfcs,
rust, cargo, and crates.io repos. To highlight a few prominent issues that may
have quite a large impact:

* [rust-lang/cargo#482](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/482)
  Specifying a custom output directory for Cargo
* [rust-lang/cargo#1007](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1007) Making
  platform-specific dependencies much more ergonomic and robust.
* [rust-lang/rfcs#1061](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1061) Filling
  in the next set of cracks in Rust's MSVC support.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, so be sure to check out many of the
P-high issues below for more upcoming projects!
