# Subteam report: tools 2015-06-02

## Highlights

The biggest news of this past week was that Emily Dunham (@edunham) has started
with the Research team at Mozilla to work on DevOps infrastructure, initially
with lots of focus on Rust! Be sure to say hi if you see her in IRC.

On the Cargo side of the world, there was a large rewrite of [RFC
1133][rfc-1133] about making Cargo aware of dependencies on libstd after some
discussion with @Ericson2314 on IRC. You'll also soon be able to enjoy [custom
output directories][cargo-custom], [speedier compiles][cargo-speedy], and [easy
copy/paste commands][cargo-copy]. Some awesome work by @wca has also [brought
Cargo to FreeBSD][cargo-freebsd]!

Back over in the compiler, new snapshots have [been registered][pr-25790],
enabling MSVC to [bootstrap from itself][msvc-boot] after [fixing some minor
bugs][msvc-bugs], and the next step for MSVC is to [update LLVM and implement
unwinding][msvc-unwinding]. Please jump in today if you're interested in working
with MSVC as everything should be operational except for unwinding, and we're
eager to hear about your experiences! In terms of porting, efforts to set up
more FreeBSD are also underway, and soon should have some auto builders set up.

Nick's benchmarking bot is also chugging along, [collecting data][bench-data]
and will soon be viewable with a nice UI!
