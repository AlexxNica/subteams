# Subteam report: tools 2016-03-25

## Highlights

* Now that rustbuild can bootstrap new hosts for the compiler,
  [there are now][free-enable] nightly *compilers* for five new platforms, with
  Cargo following quite soon!  These artifacts are all lightly tested, however,
  and some broader testing would be much appreciated!

  If you've got a new host target you'd like to see builds of rustc and Cargo
  for, ping `acrichto` on IRC (or @alexcrichton on GitHub) and we'll try to get
  it set up!

* The built-in test runner [now has a flag][test-quiet] to have quieter output
  when running tests (one dot per test instead of one line)

* A new test suite [has been added][cargotest] to the compiler which should help
  detect regression on a broader range of the ecosystem when landing any change
  to rust-lang/rust

* A number of instances of [seemingly infinite recursion][cargo-recurse] in
  Cargo have been solved through a more optimized traversal of the dependency
  space when resolving dependencies.

* Cargo's [style for printing errors][cargo-errors] has changed to be much more
  readable.

* Cargo [will now read the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable][cargoflags] to pass
  flags to the compiler for all crates as part of a compilation.

* Cargo [should now correctly handle concurrent invocations][cargo-flock] and
  ensure that global state is not corrupted and builds complete.

* The multirust-rs project [has now grown the initial rustup][rustup]
  implementation which will soon be deployed!
