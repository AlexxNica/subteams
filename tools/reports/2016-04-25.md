# Subteam report: tools 2016-04-25

## Highlights

The following RFCs were accepted this past week:

* [RFC 1510](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1510) - Adding a new crate
  type of `cdylib` for "C-like dynamic libraries"

* [RFC 1535](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1535) - Adding a stable `-C
  overflow-checks` flag to the compiler.

Similarly, another RFC in FCP was debated, but not quite merged yet. Feedback is
always appreciated!

* [RFC 1525](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1525) - Adding workspaces to
  Cargo.

Otherwise, some notable PRs this week were:

* Rust 1.8 [was released][rust18]! Thanks again to @steveklabnik for the blog
  post, @brson for preparing the release artifacts, and of course the whole
  community for the excellent release!

* The rustbuild build system continues forward with [support for tidy][tidy],
  [ninja support][ninja], [verifying downloads][verify], [compiletest test
  suites][rpass] (aka run-pass, compile-fail, etc), and [markdown tests][doctest].

* Rust now bootstraps [from the previous stable release][bootstrap] instead of
  from an arbitrary snapshot. This means that the 1.10 compiler will bootstrap
  from the release 1.9 compiler.

* Cargo [now exposes][authors] authors to compiled crates through
  `CARGO_PKG_AUTHORS`.

* The `cargo doc` command [now supports][doclib] `--lib` and `--bin` flags and
  `cargo test` [similarly supports][doctest2] a `--doc` option now.
