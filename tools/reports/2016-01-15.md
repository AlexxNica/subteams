## Highlights

* [Initial support for PNaCl][pnacl] is in the Makefiles
* [The compiler itself now has rpath enabled by default][rpath] to avoid
  requiring the usage of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for downloaded installers.
* A patch to [use the gold linker by default][gold1] landed, but it was
  [unfortunately reverted][gold2] due to bugs
* The compiler can now emit errors in [JSON format][json]
* Initial support for [powerpc64][powerpc] has landed.
* The website has seen a [major revamp][website].
* The RFC for [Cargo target specific dependencies][target] will remain in FCP
  for awhile longer as the syntax is hammered out a bit more.
